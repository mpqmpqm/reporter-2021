Reporter is a [quantified self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self)
mobile web app that lets users choose what to quantify.

Users select one or more emoji to associate with a particular board. Tapping on
an emoji sends a report of that event to the Firestore database, and the app
charts the number of reports over time in a calendar view that facilitates trend
visualization.

Everyone starts out with a predefined `Mood` board, but users can choose what to
track and how to express the different possibilities. The visual feedback for
button presses encourages so-called "smashing."

One fun aspect of the app is that different users will choose more and less
metaphorical emoji to represent the phenomena they're tracking. A friend of mine
uses â˜” for "rainy" moods. On the other hand one of my boards uses the
relatively direct ðŸ’§ to track when I last watered my plants.

Use the calendar view to spot trends in the phenomena you're tracking. This user
is having a fairly ðŸ˜˜ June, with a couple small "blue" patches. Selecting a date
on the calendar summons a modal with precise report counts for that day.

The app is written in Next. It performs server-side authentication and uses
react-router for client-side routing, with Google Cloud Firestore on the back
end to manage users and data.
